#
# Foray into Emotion Detection (EA), a subset of Sentiment Analysis 
# (SA) that is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
# Specifically, develop a textual-based Emotion Detection learning
# solution. 
#
# Given a sentence, predict the category of emotion of the author
# penning the sentence. 
#
# This implementation is based upon the Paul Ekman Discrete Emotion
# Model (DEM) of human emotion with 6 categories, alongside an
# additional "neutral" category. Together, the 7 possible solutions
# for the model are:
#  - Joy
#  - Sadness
#  - Fear
#  - Anger
#  - Disgust
#  - Surprise
#  - Neutral
#
# Train the model on a combination of datasets obtained from online
# resources, as well as with homegrown personally labelled datsets. 
# Allow for different combinations of datasets to account for unknown
# differences between subjective labels and/or quality of data. 
# The datasets that may be combined are:
