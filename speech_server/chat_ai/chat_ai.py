#
# Transformers powered Natural Language Processing introductory
# project. Utilize the Persona-Chat dataset to fine tune a ConvAIModel,
# with a base pretrained model weights provided by Hugging Face. 
#
# Designed to be utilized alongside KotakeeOS speech_server to allow
# users to "chat" with Kotakee. The contents of the "persona" of the
# user may be modified by changing the user_personality.json file.
#
# Additional enhancements TODO:
#  - Automatically add to the user_personality.json file while
#    conversing.
#  - Generate more entries in the dataset to better fine-tune
#    the model. 
#  - Improve model performance.
