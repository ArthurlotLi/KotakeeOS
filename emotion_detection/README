Textual Emotion Detection Model

RoBERTa Large powered Natural Language Processing project. Given a
line of text, predict the emotion category under which that text falls 
under. Based upon the Paul Ekman Discrete Emotion Model (DEM) of human 
emotion with 6 categories, alongside an additional "neutral" category. 

Implemented as part of KotakeeOS Speech Server with a companion Emotion 
Representation class that is tied into the server's ability to output
speech. That is to say, whenever the program says anything, an accompanying
emotion will be predicted and presented to the user with a visual 
representation. 

To use EmotionDetectionAI, you need to make sure you do some manual steps to allow your
local environment to function correctly.

1. Install pytorch to train the model. Training the model requires CUDA, 
   for which you must go to pytorch.org. 

2. Install everything required by EmotionDetectionAI. Run:

   pip install -r requirements.txt 

3. Manually acquire roberta-large_fine-tuned and insert it inside the 
   ./models folder.
